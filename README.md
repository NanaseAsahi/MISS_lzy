# Title: MISS: An Incomplete Tabular Data Representation System with Missing Mechanism Learning
## Introduction

This folder (i.e., ./code) holds the source codes of the proposed system MISS on top of the four transformer-based models, including

  - MISS-saint (in ./coda/saint/saint-main)
  - MISS-tabular (in ./coda/tabular/tabular/tabular-dl-num-embeddings-main-our)
  - MISS-tabformer (in ./coda/representation/TabSurvey/TabSurvey-main)
  - MISS-npt (in ./code/non-parametric-transformers-main/non-parametric-transformers-main-our)
## Requirements

To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
